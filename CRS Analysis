Data Analysis compared to Benford Frequencies

	When comparing varying data sets to the Benford expected frequencies, we see that real world data doesn't correlate well with 
the Benford expectations. While benford is a neat and clean approximation of what you could expect from a theoretical point of view,
world data proves to be as different as the data sets themselves. Some numbers will match up decently, however most are completely off
from Benford. When comparing real world random numbers from Wine recognition data on the UCI Machine Learning Repository we see that the
number 1 shows up 43.3% of the time where as Benford expects 36%, this is probably due to the numbers being categorized by 1,2,3 and the
alchohol content starting with 1. We see that real life is much different from Benford due to classifications we as humans use.
